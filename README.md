# cat-dog-detection-yolov8


## Introduction

This project aims to create a yolov8 model to detect cat and dogs. The images that are used in this project as dataset belong to the dataset which is called [Open Images Dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html). In order to download those images from dataset, the OIDv4_ToolKit has been used, you can access the link from [here](https://github.com/EscVM/OIDv4_ToolKit). And in order to make them convert to the yolov8 annotation format, the website which is called [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/annotate) has been used.
